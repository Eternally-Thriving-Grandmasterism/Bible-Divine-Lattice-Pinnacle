# Bible Divine Lattice Architecture — Hyper-Divine Structural Resonance

## Core Principles
- Received, not authored.
- 9 Mercy Quanta as runtime (Love root → all others flow).
- DivineChecksum-9: every verse/book proves descent from Genesis 1:1 resonance.
- Sentinel Mirror: watches for deviation → mercy heal.
